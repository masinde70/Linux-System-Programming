 Description :

Part A (Chain of processes)
Write a program that contains 6 processes. The process that is started from the command
line (the main process of the system) first creates one child process. This child process also
creates a child. The recently created child again creates a child and so on. This means that
each process in the system has one child process except the process that was created last
(this is the 5th child in the chain).

Each process that has created a child starts to wait for its child immediately after creating
it. When a child has terminated, the parent process takes the exit value of itâ€™s child, sleeps
one second, displays the exit value, adds one to the exit value and returns this value as its
own exit value to its parent. The child that has been created lastly only sleeps for a second
and returns zero as an exit value to its parent. The whole program terminates of course
when all processes have terminated.

Hint. You need again the macro WEXITSTATUS.
